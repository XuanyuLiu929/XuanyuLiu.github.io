Hi, I'm Xuanyu Liu. I am a second-year master's student in the <a href='https://www.si.umich.edu/'>School of Information</a> at University of Michigan. During my master, I've had the honor of learning from and collaborating with expert HCI researchers, including <a href='https://zhenbai.io/'>Dr. Zhen Bai</a> at University of Rochester, <a href='https://www.gabrielamarcu.com/'>Dr. Gabriela Marcu</a>, <a href='https://yardi.people.si.umich.edu/'>Prof. Sarita Schoenebeck</a>, and <a href='https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~profdj/'>Dr. Dhruv Jain</a> at University of Michigan, <a href='https://raylc.org/'>Dr. Ray LC</a> at City University of Hong Kong, and <a href='https://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/eps/en/peoples/prof-so-wing-chee-catherine/'>Prof. Wing-chee So</a>. Prior to joining UMich, I obtained my bachelor's degree at University College London, advised by <a href='https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/30634-aneesha-singh'>Dr. Aneesha Singh</a>.

As a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher, my research aims to examine how technology can genuinely support marginalized communities. I'm particularly focused on developing inclusive design approaches that center users as experts in their own experiences.
